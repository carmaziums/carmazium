// CarMazium Terms & Conditions — content model + full legal text.
//
// PORTED VERBATIM from the web app (src/app/terms/page.tsx lines 14-856).
// Mobile previously carried 10 broad hand-written sections that predated web's
// 2026-08-14 rewrite (commit 8f54f6e9), which meant the two platforms were
// presenting materially different legal terms for the same service.
//
// This file is a byte-for-byte copy of web's content model and SECTIONS array.
// DO NOT edit the wording here. The source document is CarMazium Ltd (company
// no. 17053307, "Last Updated: 13 August 2026"), 83 numbered sections, and the
// numbering matches the source 1:1 so nothing gets renumbered, merged or
// reworded out of step with the legal text. If the terms change, re-copy this
// file from web rather than editing either copy by hand.

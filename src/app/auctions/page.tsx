/**
 * Trade Exchange landing dashboard — the menu of what the room contains.
 *
 * /auctions used to BE the auction browser. It is now the section index, and
 * the browser lives at /auctions/browse. The URL was kept rather than moved to
 * /trade-exchange on purpose: renaming it would break existing links and SEO,
 * the /auctions/live/[id] and /auctions/won/[id] children, and the backend's
 * returnPath allowlist (/^\/(buy-cars|auctions)\//) that /auctions/browse still
 * satisfies.
 *
 * THIS WHOLE PAGE IS PUBLIC, deliberately. Hero, section menu and How It Works
 * show no vehicle, no price and no live bid — they are the dealer-recruitment
 * pitch, and gating them would hide the Trade Exchange from search and from the
 * exact audience it exists to attract.
 *
 * The gate sits one click further in. "Enter the auction room" goes to
 * /auctions/browse, which requires a verified dealer, and the auction endpoints
 * refuse everyone else server-side (VerifiedDealerGuard) — so the trade stock is
 * protected by the API, not by whether this menu rendered.

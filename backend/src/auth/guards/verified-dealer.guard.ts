/**
 * Restricts a route to dealers whose KYC has been approved.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS ON TOP OF RolesGuard: role DEALER alone is self-serve. A
 * buyer can switch their own account to DEALER from the profile page and get
 * the dealer dashboard in limited mode — that is intended, it is how a dealer
 * onboards. What it must NOT buy them is the trade stock: live trade bids are
 * the dealers' cost base, and a retail buyer who reads them learns what their
 * next car cost the forecourt. Checking the role and not the verification left
 * exactly that door open.
 *
 * ADMIN passes without a dealer profile — staff operate this room (approving
 * auction listings, resolving disputes, cancelling bids) and none of that is
 * possible from behind the wall.
 *
 * Reads isVerified from the database rather than from the session user. The
 * session caches the user object, so a dealer approved partway through a
 * session would otherwise keep being refused until they signed out and back
 * in — the one moment they are most likely to be watching.

/**
 * Presents listings created by an admin as CarMazium's own, rather than under
 * the individual staff member's personal name.
 *
 * WHY: admins list at any tier for free and go live without review (see
 * ListingsService.publishListing). But nothing was changing who the listing
 * appeared to be FROM. An ADMIN account is not a DEALER, so the seller block
 * fell through to `${firstName} ${lastName}` and rendered the staff member's
 * real name, badged "Verified Seller" — indistinguishable from a private
 * individual, and publishing an employee's name to every buyer.
 *
 * WHY HERE AND NOT IN THE UI: seller identity is rendered in a dozen places —
 * the detail page twice, listing cards, auction pages, chat, won-auctions —
 * and the mobile app renders it again from the same API. Branding at the API
 * boundary means every one of those is correct without knowing anything about
 * admins, and mobile gets it for free. Threading an `isAdminListing` condition
 * through each render site is the pattern that produced the seller-contact leak
 * and the CORS drift elsewhere in this codebase.
 *
 * The account's real identity is not destroyed, only its public presentation:
 * `id` and `role` are untouched, so ownership, permissions, messaging and the
 * admin's own dashboard all continue to work against the real account.
